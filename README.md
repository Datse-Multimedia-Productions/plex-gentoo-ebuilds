# What
This is not an official gentoo package, only a snapshot from my local overlay that I ended up maintaining after waiting for new plex-media-server ebuilds from megacoffee and alike.

# How
If you really want to use this (lol), you may wanna spin up your local overlay.
This is how you do this: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Custom_repository
Then, git clone this into your overlay dir, so you have a structure like /usr/local/portage/media-tv/plex-media-server/...

From that point on, emerge plex-media-server should be ok.

# Thanks
Work is based on megacoffee initial ebuilds, many thanks for that!
